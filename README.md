## Dependencies
For our notebooks to work properly, following Python libraries should be installed:
* numpy,
* matplotlib,
* pandas,
* Ipython,
* [qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/).

## Using repository
We encourage everyone to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/fbm2718/qiskit_classes_PW2020
```
To run downloaded notebooks one needs
